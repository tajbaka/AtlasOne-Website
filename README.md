# AtlasOne-Website

Website URL: https://www.atlas.one/

## Summary:
AtlasOne is a web application that connects law enforcement to personas in their relative district in real time. Here we are explanining how the beautiful website was built. Unfortunately i cannot expand more on the actual web application because of an NDA.

### Tech Involved: 
* **Web Application Front End**: ReactJS and redux state management for front-end of web application.
* **Web Application Website**: GastbyJS, Graphql, Contentful and netlify for deployment. 

### Why Gatsby?: Allowing the website to be completely customizable while being really fast.
* **Goal**: To make a content management system similar to wordpress but with the blazing speed we get from using GatsbyJS.
* **Reasoning**: To avoid the need of a developer to constantly make updates to the website. The need for a super fast website to rank better in terms of Google's SEO.
* **What We Did**: Using Contentful, we made the different components, from headers, to pages to specific page items which could then be used in conjunction to build dynamically rendered pages. Similar to component building in ReactJS, in contentful we can create reusable components that can be used all accross the site.
